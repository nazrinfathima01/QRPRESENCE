### Project Description
This project automatically marks student attendance using QR code ID cards.
Students scan their ID cards via a webcam, and the system records them as present.
It generates a digital attendance report, saving time and reducing manual errors.

### The Problem statement
Manual attendance in classrooms is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to errors, especially for large classes. Teachers often spend several minutes per student, and mistakes like marking the wrong student present or absent can occur. There is a need for a fast, accurate, and automated attendance system that reduces human effort and ensures reliable record-keepin
### The Solution
[How are you solving it?]

---We solve this problem by using QR code ID cards and a scanner system. Students scan their ID cards via a webcam, the system automatically verifies their ID and marks them present. At the end, it generates a digital attendance report, saving time, reducing errors, and making attendance management efficient and accurate.
